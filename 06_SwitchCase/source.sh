Theory:

1) The bash case statement is generally used to simplify complex
   conditionals when you have multiple different choices.
2) Using the case statement instead of nested if statements will
   help you make your bash scripts more readable and easier to maintain.
3) The Bash case statement has a similar concept with the Javascript or
   C switch statement.
4) The main difference is that unlike the C switch statement, the Bash
   case statement doesnâ€™t continue to search for a pattern match once it has
   found one and executed statements associated with that pattern.
5) SYNTAX:
